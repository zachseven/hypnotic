**I see what you meant.**

A programming language that doesn't scream at you. It understands.

```
* "Hello, world!"
```

## Why hypnotIC?

Because code should understand *you*, not the other way around.

- **No indentation fascism** - Use `IC` to close blocks, not whitespace
- **Phonetic shortcuts** - Type how you think (`4` = for, `wyl` = while, `?` = if)
- **Forgiving syntax** - Warnings, not errors when possible
- **Fun** - Programming should be `fun`, not frustrating

## Installation

```bash
pip install hypnotic
```

Or just grab `hypnotic.py` and run it directly:

```bash
python hypnotic.py
```

## Quick Start

### Hello World
```
* "Hello, world!"
```

### Variables
```
name = "Zach"
age = 25
active = t
```

### Conditionals
```
? age > 21
    * "welcome"
file age > 18
    * "almost"
Ls
    * "nope"
IC
```

### Loops
```
4 i n 10
    * i
IC
```

### Functions
```
fun greet name
    * "Hello, " + name
IC

greet "world"
```

### FizzBuzz (because you were wondering)
```
4 i n 100
    ? i mold 15 iz 0
        * "FizzBuzz"
    file i mold 3 iz 0
        * "Fizz"
    file i mold 5 iz 0
        * "Buzz"
    Ls
        * i
    IC
IC
```

## Running hypnotIC

```bash

hypnotic

# Run a file
hypnotic myprogram.ic

# One-liner

# Debug mode (see tokens and AST)
hypnotic -d myprogram.ic
```

## File Extension

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for more programs:
- `showcase.ic` - Tour of language features
- `hello.ic` - The classic

## Philosophy

1. **IC sees your intent** - The parser tries to understand what you meant
2. **No indentation fascism** - Use `IC` to close blocks
3. **Phonetic shortcuts** - Type how you think
4. **Forgiving** - Warnings, not errors when possible
5. **Fun** - Programming should be `fun`, not frustrating
